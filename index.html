    <h1>Melanie Halem</h1>
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>My name is Melanie Halem. I am passionate about the environment and communications, and I want to use my expertise to find and forward climate solutions. I love creating and consuming art, whether it be paintings, drawing, writing, or poetry. I just returned home to the United States after living in Madrid, Spain for the last two years, where I taught Spanish elementary students. I am about to move to San Francisco, California, where I plan to begin my career in communications.</p>
    <h2>Hobbies and Interests</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>I enjoy drawing and painting in my free time, especially still objects.</li>
        <li>I love to run, and I hope to run a half or full marathon one day.</li>
        <li>I find that a good book can lend itself to a great conversation, so I enjoy reading literary classics.</li>
        <li>Despite the heaviness of the subject, I am endlessly intrigued by the complexities of the climate crisis. I like to read scientific studies, news stories, and creative fiction about the environmental crisis. I love being introduced to new perspectives of the issue.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Career Goals</h2>
    <p>I hope to find a career that marries my interests in communications, the environment, and politics. I would love to work on a communications or research team to get a piece of environmental legislation passed in the United States. I want to become an expert in greenhouse gas emissions, using my background in mathematics to aid in sound policy creation.</p>
    <p>I am also very interested in art. I believe that art can be used to inspire change, and I want to use art in communications strategies. I also hope that at some point in my life, I am paid to make one piece of art. </p>
